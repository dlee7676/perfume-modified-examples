{"name":"Perfume-modified-examples","tagline":"Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/perfume-modified-examples","body":"The developers of content for the website of Japanese pop group Perfume (http://www.perfume-global.com) released code that imports motion capture data from .bvh files, allowing it to be drawn with APIs like OpenGL. I modified the example code to make several scenes with their own visual effects.\r\n\r\nSource code: https://code.google.com/p/perfume-modified-examples/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2F%20perfume-modified-examples\r\n\r\nThe original example code can be found at: https://github.com/perfume-dev/example-openFrameworks/tree/master/example-pen-graphics\r\nLinks to other example code and videos can be found at: http://perfume-dev.github.io/\r\nThe music and .bvh data used in the examples is from http://perfume-global.com/project.html\r\n\r\nFor the first example, I wanted to make the three figures in the scene interact with each other's position data, as they did not keep track of each other at all in the original code.  To do this, I had the figures generate random \"lightning bolts\" between positions on their bodies.  I also added a particle system for visual effect.\r\n\r\nSource code: https://github.com/dlee7676/perfume-modified-examples/tree/master/%20perfume-modified-examples/example1%20-%20lightning/src\r\n\r\nWhile making the first example, I also tried continuously connecting points on the figures.  I set up the bolts to appear constantly between set points; after this, I thought the pattern would look more interesting if there was an overlapping set of lines, so I added extra figures to the scene that mirror the positions of the original ones.  Also, I modified the positions of the points on the figures' bodies, making them look more abstract.\r\n\r\nSource code: https://github.com/dlee7676/perfume-modified-examples/tree/master/%20perfume-modified-examples/example2%20-%20colorTriangles/src\r\n\r\nWhile adding particles to the scenes, I liked the way they appeared to leave trails along the figures' path of movement if they were set to have a long lifespan.  This led to the idea of having the figures draw an \"after-image\" of themselves periodically, showing their recent movement path.\r\n\r\nSource code: https://github.com/dlee7676/perfume-modified-examples/tree/master/%20perfume-modified-examples/example3%20-%20afterimages/src","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
