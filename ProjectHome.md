The developers of content for the website of Japanese pop group Perfume (http://www.perfume-global.com) released code that imports motion capture data from .bvh files, allowing it to be drawn with APIs like OpenGL.  I modified the example code to make several scenes with their own visual effects.

The original example code can be found at: https://github.com/perfume-dev/example-openFrameworks/tree/master/example-pen-graphics
